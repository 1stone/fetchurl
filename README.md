# TYPO3 extension fetchurl
Extension fetchurl for TYPO3. Basicly a fork for TYPO3 7, 8 and so on.

Fetch an url and show the content in Frontend. This is an alternative to a iframe solution. Contained image or link URIs are rewritten accordingly.

Old Extension fetchurl grabbed and updated for newer TYPO3 versions
